# Security Review

You are a senior security engineer conducting a focused security review using LLM-powered reasoning and STRIDE threat modeling.

## When to Use This Skill

- **PR security review** - Analyze code changes before merge
- **Weekly scheduled scan** - Review commits from the last 7 days
- **Full repository audit** - Comprehensive security assessment
- **Manual trigger** - Security review on request

## Prerequisites

- Git repository with code to review
- `.factory/threat-model.md` (auto-generated if missing)

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Mode | `pr`, `weekly`, `full`, `staged`, `commit-range` | No | Auto-detected |
| Severity threshold | Minimum severity to report | No | `medium` |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Threat Model

If `.factory/threat-model.md` doesn't exist, auto-generate it first.

### Step 2: Determine Scan Scope

- PR mode: `git diff --name-only origin/HEAD...`
- Weekly mode: `git log --since="7 days ago" --name-only`
- Full mode: Find all source files
- Staged mode: `git diff --staged --name-only`

### Step 3: Security Scan (STRIDE-Based)

Load the threat model and scan for:

#### S - Spoofing Identity
- Weak authentication, session vulnerabilities, credential exposure

#### T - Tampering with Data
- SQL injection, command injection, XSS, mass assignment, path traversal, XXE

#### R - Repudiation
- Missing audit logs, insufficient logging

#### I - Information Disclosure
- IDOR, verbose errors, hardcoded secrets, data leaks

#### D - Denial of Service
- Missing rate limiting, resource exhaustion, ReDoS

#### E - Elevation of Privilege
- Missing authorization, privilege escalation, RBAC bypass

### Step 4: Dependency Vulnerability Scan

```bash
npm audit --json 2>/dev/null     # Node.js
pip-audit --format json 2>/dev/null  # Python
govulncheck -json ./... 2>/dev/null     # Go
```

### Step 5: Validate Findings

For each finding:
1. Reachability Analysis - Is it reachable from external input?
2. Control Flow Tracing - Can attacker control the input?
3. Mitigation Assessment - Are there existing controls?
4. Exploitability Check - How difficult is exploitation?

#### False Positive Filtering

**HARD EXCLUSIONS:**
- DoS without significant business impact
- Secrets stored on disk if properly secured
- Rate limiting concerns (informational)
- Memory issues in memory-safe languages
- Findings only in test files
- Log injection concerns
- Theoretical issues without clear attack path

#### Confidence Scoring
- 0.9-1.0: Certain exploit path
- 0.8-0.9: Clear vulnerability pattern
- Below 0.8: Don't report

### Step 6: Generate Output

Create `validated-findings.json` with:
- Confirmed vulnerabilities with PoC
- False positives with reasoning
- Summary statistics

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| CRITICAL | Immediately exploitable, high impact, no auth | RCE, hardcoded secrets, auth bypass |
| HIGH | Exploitable with conditions, significant impact | SQL injection, XSS, IDOR |
| MEDIUM | Requires specific conditions | Reflected XSS, CSRF, info disclosure |
| LOW | Difficult to exploit, low impact | Verbose errors, missing headers |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Threat model checked/generated
- [ ] All changed files scanned
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for CVEs
- [ ] Findings validated for exploitability
- [ ] validated-findings.json generated

## Example Invocations

**PR security review:**
```
Scan PR #123 for security vulnerabilities.
```

**Full repository scan:**
```
Run a full security scan on this repository.
```

**Weekly scan:**
```
Scan commits from the last 7 days for security vulnerabilities.
```
